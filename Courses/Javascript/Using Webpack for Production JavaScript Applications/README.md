Using Webpack for Production JavaScript Applications
 64 minutes
Webpack is one of the most popular tools for bundling JavaScript applications and libraries, and it's growing more popular every day. [It is so loaded with features that it's sometimes difficult to know what's even possible.

In this course, Kent C. [Dodds takes you through some of the most valuable features of the Webpack JavaScript module bundler. [We'll learn a ton about what it takes to optimize your Webpack configuration and your application to make it as fast as it can possibly be. [We'll also go over what it takes to setup and write tests with webpack, Karma, Mocha, and Chai.

This course covers Webpack 2, but should also be relevant for Webpack 1.x.
