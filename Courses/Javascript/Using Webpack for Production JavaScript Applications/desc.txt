Using Webpack for Production JavaScript Applications
 64 minutes
Webpack is one of the most popular tools for bundling JavaScript applications and libraries, and it's growing more popular every day. It is so loaded with features that it's sometimes difficult to know what's even possible.

In this course, Kent C. Dodds takes you through some of the most valuable features of the Webpack JavaScript module bundler. We'll learn a ton about what it takes to optimize your Webpack configuration and your application to make it as fast as it can possibly be. We'll also go over what it takes to setup and write tests with webpack, Karma, Mocha, and Chai.

This course covers Webpack 2, but should also be relevant for Webpack 1.x.
