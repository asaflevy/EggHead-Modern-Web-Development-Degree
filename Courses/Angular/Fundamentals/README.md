## Angular 2 Fundamentals
### 45 minutes

Heads-up: This course is dated. [It is still useful and covers many of the core concepts that you will find in Angular 2. [Some of the syntax has changed with the latest pre-releases. [We are in the process of creating piles of amazing content for Angular 2's upcoming release. [You should probably spend some time with the RxJS courses in the meantime. [ðŸ˜„ Angular 2 is currently in pre-release, but it's time to start learning the basics and the "Angular 2 Way" of building applications. [In Angular 2, the component is the core primitive building block of your application. [This series of lessons you will dive into components, and learn how they are assembled in Angular 2. [It should be noted that Angular 2 is beta software! We will be keeping these lessons as up to date as possible. [If you want a deep-dive into getting started with your TypeScript development environment, check out this course: Up and Running with TypeScript
