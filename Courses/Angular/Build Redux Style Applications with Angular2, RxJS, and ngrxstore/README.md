## Build Redux Style Applications with Angular2, RxJS, and ngrx/store
### 41 minutes

Angular 2 has many built-in features for working closely with RxJS to help you build fully reactive applications. This course will teach you how to use Angular 2 with RxJS. We will learn how to use the ngrx/store library to manage state in a very clean reactive "Redux style". This course assumes you've got a working knowledge of Angular 2 and reactive programming with RxJS. If you don't, you might want to watch Angular 2 Fundamentals and this Introduction to Reactive Programming with RxJS. You might also enjoy Step by Step Async Programming with RxJS and this course on Redux by its creator Dan Abramov!
