Build an Angular 2 Instant Search Component
 11 minutes
In this course you will learn more about using observables in Angular 2. We are going to explore the new HTTP service, and how we can leverage the power of observables and RxJS to build a rock solid instant search component with a handful of operators.

You will learn operators like map, distinctUntilChanged, debounceTime, merge, flatMap, and switchMap by applying them to a real-world component. By the end of this course you will have a clear understanding of how components can be designed around the concept of event streams which are wired together like modular building blocks.
